# Graph_Sequence_Network
Graph_Sequence_Network is a nerual model that can compare similarity between two function.

The two function can exact from both binary file or one from binary file and the other from source code or both from source code.
As long as it can be exacted as *CFG*.

You can exact sample data by [CFG_C_Flex](https://github.com/owNoeXist/CFG_C_Flex) and [CFG_IDAPython](https://github.com/owNoeXist/CFG_IDAPython).

## How to run it
These codes are based on Tensorflow2.4.

The network based on GRU and GAT.
